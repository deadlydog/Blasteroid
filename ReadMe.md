# Blasteroid

This is a Space Invaders type of game.
I created Blasteroid while I was a student at the University of Regina using C++ and DirectX.

## History

Blasteroid was the second game I created.
I started it in 2004, and continued to work on it into 2005.
The game has 3 levels, which are loaded from script files and more levels could easily be added.
The enemies use a simple AI system that I developed to determine when to attack your ship and when to flee, although it may be tough to see this as the screen often quickly fills up with enemies.

Most of the graphics and sound effects were made by me, but the music and some of the graphics are from 3rd party sources.

## Get it

[Download it](Installers/Blasteroid%20Installer.exe) and check it out.
If you don't want to 'install' the game, you can just [download the executable file](Installers/Blasteroid%20Executable.zip) and run the, although the fonts may not display correctly.

## Requirements

You will need at least DirectX 8.1 installed to play the game.
